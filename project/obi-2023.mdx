This project was created using Next.js and TailwindCSS for the frontend. The choice of Next.js was motivated by its built-in SEO capabilities and superior routing compared to plain React. TailwindCSS was employed for its simplicity in handling styling.

> ## The Problems and Lesson Learned

Undertaking my inaugural paid project as a lead developer presented significant challenges and valuable lessons. The pressure of creating a website from scratch was intense. A major hurdle was crafting a secure dashboard with authentication and authorization, something I had never done before, especially the requirement of JWT-based login. However, I'm grateful to report that I successfully completed this website in just one month. This experience has equipped me with invaluable skills and resilience for future endeavors.
