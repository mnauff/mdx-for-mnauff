This project was created using Next.js and TailwindCSS for the frontend. The choice of Next.js was motivated by its built-in SEO capabilities and superior routing compared to plain React. TailwindCSS was employed for its simplicity in handling styling.


> ## The Problems and Lesson Learned

This was my first time being a website developer for events. I had never learned **Typescript**. When I started learning them, I was initially overwhelmed by the complexity, but with determination and a fighting spirit, I can now work with **Typescript** without hesitation.

Furthermore, state management and API Fetching was a concept I had never heard of before. Nevertheless, I put in my best effort to complete my tasks step by step, watching YouTube videos to gain the knowledge needed to work with it.
